# 310 Lab Group 13
## **Assignment 2:**
### **Description:**
We are creating a chatbot with a focus on users who are experiencing loneliness. It will have a UI and respond to user accordingly. It will also have a detected risk level and from that can inform the user if they are in danger from themselves. We plan on using swing for java to create a simplistic UI to begin with.
### **Chosen SDLC:**

We chose to use Agile Scrum as it will allow us to work quickly through a feature and then go back and choose to work on something else. This will work better than other SDLC for us because we will operate much quicker when working on one feature together and can help figure out problems faster.
